Dear User! 
This is the Mount Everest Wordpress Theme Project. 
On the Home Page I strongly reccommend you to try out my nice looking widgets, called box1-3 with a some custom html.
For test purposes I leave some demo code for you, in the demo_code/demo-html-for-box-widgets.html file.
You have also option to use sidebar widgets. 

The Theme has search and pagination also integrated.
On the front-page u have the option to customise the Showcase section (picture, header, paragraph and button). 
Have Fun with the Theme!
