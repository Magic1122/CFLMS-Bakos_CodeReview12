Dear User! 
This is the Mount Everest Wordpress Theme Project. 
On the Home Page I strongly reccommend you to try out my nice looking widgets, called box1-3 with a some custom html.
For test purposes I leave you some demo code for you:
Box1: 
<!-- <i class="fa fa-plane" aria-hidden="true"></i>
              <h3>Cat Ipsum Dolor</h3>
              <p>Kitty scratches couch bad kitty groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked knock over christmas tree suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage dead stare with ears cocked, and where is my slave?</p> -->
Box2:
<!-- <i class="fa fa-globe" aria-hidden="true"></i>
              <h3>Cat Ipsum Dolor</h3>
              <p>Kitty scratches couch bad kitty groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked knock over christmas tree suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage dead stare with ears cocked, and where is my slave?</p> -->



Box3:

<!-- <i class="fa fa-suitcase" aria-hidden="true"></i>
              <h3>Cat Ipsum Dolor</h3>
              <p>Kitty scratches couch bad kitty groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked knock over christmas tree suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage dead stare with ears cocked, and where is my slave?</p> -->

You have also option to use sidebar widgets. 

The Theme has search and pagination also integrated.
On the homepage u have the option to customise the Showcase section (picture, header, paragraph and button). 
Have Fun with the Theme!
